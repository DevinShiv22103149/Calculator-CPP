# A Simple Calculator
This code implements a simple calculator program in C++ that performs seven different mathematical operations: sine, square, tangent, cosine, natural logarithm, logarithm with base 10, and power. Each function takes floating-point values as parameters.

Features
Sine (sin)
Square (square)
Tangent (tan)
Cosine (cos)
Natural Logarithm (log)
Logarithm with base 10 (baseLog)
Power (power)
How it Works
The program is menu-driven and uses a switch-case statement to execute the chosen operation. The user selects an operation by inputting a corresponding number, and the program performs the selected mathematical operation.

Functions
Power(float x, float y): Calculates x raised to the power y.
Sine(float x): Calculates the sine of x.
Square(float x): Calculates the square root of x.
Cos(float x): Calculates the cosine of x.
Tan(float x): Calculates the tangent of x.
Log(float x): Calculates the natural logarithm (base e) of x.
Baselog(float x): Calculates the logarithm of x with base 10.
